# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Using-CNN

### Introduction:
The main purpose of this project is to create a real time road sign recognition application.

### Installations:
Clone the repository using the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hemanthhh/Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Using-CNN.git
```

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [OpenCV Python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has some of the above packages.

You can install all the required python packages from the requirements.txt using following command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Application
